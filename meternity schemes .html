<h1>Bal Sakha Yojna </h1>
Bal Sakha Yojana was incepted in January 2009, to make accessible expert care by private pediatrician to all BPL and tribal children born under the ambit of the 

Chiranjeevi Yojana or in Government Health care institution. It is also meant for all the children upto 1 month age identified at risk by Mamta Abhiyan and IMNCI trained health worker as per protocols.
<h2>• The Scheme is operationalised in two parts:

    </h2>

    <h3> <li>Bal Sakha Yojana 1</li></h3>
This part of scheme is applicable to all babies born in BPL, neo-middle class families (with income limit of Rs. 2 lakh) and Tribal APL families (Non Income Tax Paying) under Chiraneevi Yojana, or at CHCs and District Hospitals, where specialized pediatric services are not available.

Under this scheme, the pediatrician attends all eligible newborns at the place of birth and has to ensure their survival by providing early neonatal care including immunizations at birth, nutrition advice, etc.

The gynecologist has to ensure 2 days stay of mother and baby after delivery to cover dangers of immediate post partum period. In case the infant requires any further care, the baby has to be transferred and treated in the pediatrician’s NICU.


If the infant requires any high level of care such as ventilator care, the baby will be transferred to Level 3 NICU in medical college hospitals and given facility / money for ambulance charges.

A package of remuneration is worked out for a total of 100 babies covered as under:
Thus the pediatrician will receive Rs 2,69,000 for 100 consecutive babies treated. Transfer charges shall be given for transfer of babies from one facility to another by the pediatrician as above and will be reimbursed to him / her as per actual.
<h3>Bal Sakha Yojana Part 2</h3>
This is applicable to all babies born to BPL, neo-middle class (with income limit of Rs. 2 lakh) and Tribal APL families (Non Income Tax Paying) born at other places than those mentioned in part 1, i.e. born at home, sub centre or a PHC.

The babies born at all places are examined as per IMNCI protocols and those who are identified in Red zone i.e. those who require further medical assistance are referred to the private pediatrician partnering under this scheme.

The health worker such as ASHA or aanganwadi worker 

escorts the baby to the pediatrician and is paid incentive for this. The pediatrician will examine and treat 100 such children referred and will admit those who require indoor care. The transfer to higher level will be done as and when required as in part 1.
